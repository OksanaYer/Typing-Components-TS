# Typing Components
Typing Components – TS

A small React + TypeScript project for practicing how to type components, props, callbacks and simple UI patterns.

What’s inside

Basic typed React components

Props with strings, numbers, booleans

Optional props (name?: string)

Union types ("loading" | "success" | "error")

Callback props (() => void)

Lists typed with arrays of objects

Inline styles with React.CSSProperties

A simple reusable layout component (Container)



A bunch of components are being rendered in `App.tsx`, your job is to add type annotations as per the comments on each component.
